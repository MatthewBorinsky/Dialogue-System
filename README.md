This was an assignment from UWO CS4482. We were told to create a dialogue system which also includes language localization. It was suggested we use xNode for the dialogue tree.

This creates a dialogue system which also has language localization.
It uses xNode for the dialogue tree and my tools 2 project (Language Selector) for the localization.
